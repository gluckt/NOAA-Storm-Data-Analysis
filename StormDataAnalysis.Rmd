## Synopsis

In this report we aim to answer two distinct questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

We will do this by examining the NOAA Storm Database, which contains information from 1950 to 2011 tracking
characteristics of major storms across the United States. These include attributes such as each storm's time 
and location, and their effects on population and economic welfare (fatalities, injuries, property damage).
